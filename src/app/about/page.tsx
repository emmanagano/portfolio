        <p>
          Hi, I’m Emma, 26 years old, based in Pampanga, Philippines. I took a
          coding bootcamp while I was living in the States and specialized in
          the PERN stack. For our capstone, we built an e-commerce site.

          Before I Learned to Code
        </h2>
        <p>
          I went to the States when I was 19 and lived there for almost five
          years. Back then, my dad wanted me to become a pilot. I made it
          halfway through the training process… until financial problems, the
          pandemic, and rising expenses made it impossible to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were dark days. I had no backup plans. I had invested years of
          my life thinking I’d become a pilot. I watched my co-pilots earn their
          licenses, helped them study, flew with them, and hyped them up for
          their flight exams. Deep down, I wished I was also achieving their
          milestones.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was heavy. It took a long time to accept that I wasn’t going to
          make a career out of flying. But I knew, at some point, I needed to
          stop wallowing and start over.

          How I Discovered My Passion for Coding
        </h2>
        <p>
          Coding gave me a way forward. I loved that I could sit in front of my
          computer and make things happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s room for error, for creativity, and for flow. I could get lost
          in it for hours and not feel drained.

            <em>Coding is everything that becoming a pilot is not.</em>

        <p>In learning to code better, I also learned so much about myself.</p>
        <div className="pl-6">
          <p>
            <strong>I love designing:</strong> playing with colors and grids.
            Learning to balance between functionality, aesthetic, and what I can
            actually code.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="pl-6">
          <p>
            <strong>I love writing:</strong> expressing myself through
            well-thought words. I have so many stories to tell, lessons to
            share, and love to give. I want them all in writing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="pl-6">
          <p>
            <strong>I’m an introvert:</strong> I’m good with people, but at the
            end of the day, being alone with my thoughts is how I bring ideas to
            life.

          Learning how to code in order to build websites became a gateway to

          It Wasn’t Instant Success
        </h2>
        <p>
          I thought graduating from a bootcamp would make things easier. I was
          wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freelancing through Upwork and Fiverr was hard. I didn’t have
          real-life client experience or a solid portfolio. I had to grind my
          way into establishing myself as a web developer. And of course, a
          bootcamp doesn’t teach you everything. There&apos;s still a lot of
          self-learning involved.

        </div>
        <p>
          It was a cycle I had to repeat over and over. I realized I still had a
          long way to go. I realized I wasn’t special.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, I wasn’t hopeless. I was just focusing on the wrong
          things. I wanted to freelance right away when I should have been
          looking for a job to gain experience.

          Why I Had to Come Home
        </h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to work in the States, but I was on a student visa. I wasn’t
          allowed to work, only study. That meant I had to find a company
          willing to sponsor my work visa.
        </p>
        <p>
          With little to no experience, and a highly competitive field, I didn’t
          stand a chance.

        <div className="pl-6">

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. But I needed to
          show how committed I was. So I flew home to the Philippines to start
          over.

          The Break I Needed
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I returned, I didn’t go straight into tech. I took a break from
          coding. I needed to improve my work ethic, re-learn how to be around
          Filipinos, and reconnect with my family.
        </p>
        <p>But it was tough.</p>

          While I was figuring things out, I worked in customer service. It
          exposed me to a different field and taught me soft skills I still use
          today. I worked as a call center agent for a Telco company, grinding
          through the night and sleeping during the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t easy. But it made me stronger. I have so much respect for

          Finally Breaking Into Tech
        </h2>
        <p>After everything, I finally landed two jobs in tech.</p>
        <p>
          My first was as a <strong>Junior Web Support</strong> at{" "}
          <strong>Olly Olly</strong>, a digital marketing company in the U.S. It
          was my entry point into the industry, a solid first job in my field. I
          learned a lot about maintaining websites, troubleshooting technical
          issues, and working with a team. It gave me the validation I needed
          and motivated me to keep going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I worked as a <strong>Freelance Web Developer</strong>. A
          client, through a personal connection, hired me to build a platform to
          showcase his articles and promote his consulting services. I had full
          control over the layout and design. It was the first time I built a
          real website for a real client. From start to finish, I got to bring
          something to life. It was both challenging and deeply rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m still building, still growing. The journey hasn’t been easy:
          frustrating, exhausting, and full of uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>But I wouldn’t trade it for anything else.</p>
