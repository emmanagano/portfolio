11:T113f,<h2>Before I Found the Job I Loved…</h2>
<p>There was this chapter of my life I rarely talk about.<br>
I was working in the BPO industry: a call center agent on graveyard shifts, answering calls from people halfway across the world.</p>
<p>Everyone says it’s good money.<br>
Everyone says “you’ll get used to it.”</p>
<p>But no one really talks about the cost.</p>
<h2>The Calls That Hurt More Than They Should</h2>
<p>I hated the customers.</p>
<p>The ones who already knew how to fix their concern but still called to yell.<br>
The ones who demanded an “American representative.”<br>
The ones who screamed at me like I wasn’t human.</p>
<p><em>“You know what, fck you and go fck yourself!”</em></p>
<p>One night, I answered a call from a dad. I heard him softly saying good night to his daughters. His voice was full of warmth. It was such a tender moment.</p>
<p>Then he returned to the phone and tore me to pieces.</p>
<p><em>“DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS? I HAVE TO GO TO F*CKING WORK TOMORROW—”</em></p>
<p>He was furious. I couldn’t solve his issue.<br>
He cursed me out while his kids were asleep in the other room.<br>
And I cried. Not because I was overwhelmed, but because I’m someone’s daughter too.</p>
<h2>The Real Reason I Broke Down</h2>
<p>People saw me crying at my desk and thought I was stressed from the workload.<br>
Sure, I was tired. But I’ve been overworked before. I was trained for discipline, I was a pilot for f*ck’s sake.</p>
<p>I broke down because the job made me absorb pain that wasn’t mine.<br>
That man wasn’t yelling at me. He was yelling at his own life.<br>
And I was just the random person on the other end of the line, expected to be polite, empathetic, and apologetic.</p>
<p>And when I put him on hold just so I could pee, I got scolded.</p>
<h2>The Cycle of Abuse We Pretend Is Normal</h2>
<p>Not all customers are cruel.<br>
Some are funny. Some are sweet. Some actually say thank you.</p>
<p>But the kindness never lasts long enough to protect you from the next wave of abuse.</p>
<p>And here’s the line we all get told:</p>
<p>“You’ll get used to it.”</p>
<p>No, you won’t.</p>
<p>You don’t “get used to” being screamed at daily by people who see you as less.<br>
You just adapt. You compartmentalize. You stop feeling.<br>
Or worse… you carry that pain into your real life.</p>
<h2>What It Does to You (Even When You Think You’re Fine)</h2>
<p>You think you’re fine until:</p>
<ul>
<li>You oversleep all day</li>
<li>You vape more than you breathe</li>
<li>You stop eating right</li>
<li>You ghost people who care about you</li>
<li>You numb yourself with alcohol or attention or work flings</li>
<li>You start crying alone and don’t even know why</li>
</ul>
<p>You tell yourself it’s just a job.<br>
But it chips away at your empathy, piece by piece.</p>
<h2>This Job Is A Stepping Stone</h2>
<p>And this is my point:</p>
<p>Being a call center agent shouldn’t be your endgame.<br>
It can be a stepping stone, a temporary grind, a way to survive while you figure your life out.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re working to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save for school</li>
<li>Buy your first car</li>
<li>Propose to you partner</li>
<li>Learn discipline</li>
<li>Build confidence</li>
<li>Make new friends</li>
<li>Just start somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s valid. That’s enough.<br>
But don’t get stuck thinking this is the peak of your potential.</p>
<h2>To the Agents Who Stay, You Are Stronger Than Most</h2>
<p>Some agents stay. Some even thrive. They get promoted to TL, OM, QA.<br>
They stay because they care. Because they want to protect the people around them.</p>
<p>If you’re going to give your empathy, give it to people you actually see every day.<br>
To your seatmate.<br>
To the newbie on your team.<br>
To your supervisor who’s been quietly looking out for you.</p>
<p>That’s where the honor is. Not in the industry, but in the people enduring it.</p>
<h2>So Be Proud. But Don’t Be Stagnant.</h2>
<p><em>“Kala mo kung sino, call center agent lang naman.”</em></p>
<p>That kind of shame only sticks if you don’t see anything bigger for yourself.<br>
But if you know that you’re on your way to something greater? You’ll laugh at that.</p>
<p>So be proud.<br>
Tell the world:</p>
<p>“I was an agent before I became _______.”</p>
<p>And please, for the love of God, cut off vaping.</p>
