11:Ta20,<p><em>“My ex cheated on me. Should I take them back?”</em></p>
<p>The simple answer is no.</p>
<p>Whether you’re the person who was cheated on or the one who cheated, don’t look back. Keep moving forward.</p>
<p><em>But it’s complicated</em>, you say? No, it’s not. Walk away.</p>
<h2>If You Were Cheated On</h2>
<p>Let them go.</p>
<p>They need to learn that actions have consequences. If they don’t lose someone they love because of cheating, they’ll never fully grasp the weight of their betrayal.</p>
<p>Maybe one day (and that’s a long-shot maybe), things could change. But not now. You need time to heal.</p>
<p>Premature forgiveness leads to self-destruction. You might think you can move past it, but deep down, resentment festers. They hurt you: betrayed your trust, disrespected you. You can’t love them the way you once did.</p>
<p>You’ll lie to yourself, thinking you’ve forgiven them. But in reality, you’re letting them back in because you want them to hurt like you’re hurting.</p>
<p>That’s not love.</p>
<p>If you truly love them, give it time. Only time apart can salvage what’s left. Rushing the process means harboring emotions other than love: resentment, bitterness, hate.</p>
<h2>If You Cheated</h2>
<p>First of all, screw you.</p>
<p>But let’s be honest, you’re in a vulnerable position too. Guilt is eating you alive. You’ll apologize endlessly… with gestures, sacrifices, gifts desperately trying to fix what you broke.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth: you’ll never have the upper hand again. No matter how hard you try, things will never go back to the way they were.</p>
<p>The common denominator here is time.<br>
Both sides need time to let go, heal, and reflect.</p>
<h2>Why Time Apart Is Non-Negotiable</h2>
<p>Moving on means accepting uncertainty. It’s scary because you don’t know what’s next. But that’s what makes it worth it.</p>
<p>Stop clinging to each other out of fear. Don’t promise to stay friends. Don’t talk. Let go completely.</p>
<p>Only then can you truly process what happened and grow from it.</p>
<p>Maybe, in time, you’ll realize letting go was a mistake. Or maybe you’ll meet someone else who treats you better. Or, and this is often the best case, you’ll find peace in being single and focusing on yourself.</p>
<h2>You Deserve Better</h2>
<p>Don’t deprive yourself of possibilities. Staying in a broken relationship out of fear or guilt only limits you.</p>
<p>Move on. Heal. And remember, you’re worthy of the kind of love that doesn’t make you question your value.</p>
