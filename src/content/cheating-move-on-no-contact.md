_“My ex cheated on me. Should I take them back?”_

The simple answer is no.

Whether you’re the person who was cheated on or the one who cheated, don’t look back. Keep moving forward.

_But it’s complicated_, you say? No, it’s not. Walk away.

## If You Were Cheated On

Let them go.

They need to learn that actions have consequences. If they don’t lose someone they love because of cheating, they’ll never fully grasp the weight of their betrayal.

Maybe one day (and that’s a long-shot maybe), things could change. But not now. You need time to heal.

Premature forgiveness leads to self-destruction. You might think you can move past it, but deep down, resentment festers. They hurt you: betrayed your trust, disrespected you. You can’t love them the way you once did.

You’ll lie to yourself, thinking you’ve forgiven them. But in reality, you’re letting them back in because you want them to hurt like you’re hurting.

That’s not love.

If you truly love them, give it time. Only time apart can salvage what’s left. Rushing the process means harboring emotions other than love: resentment, bitterness, hate.

## If You Cheated

First of all, screw you.

But let’s be honest, you’re in a vulnerable position too. Guilt is eating you alive. You’ll apologize endlessly… with gestures, sacrifices, gifts desperately trying to fix what you broke.

But here’s the truth: you’ll never have the upper hand again. No matter how hard you try, things will never go back to the way they were.

The common denominator here is time.  
Both sides need time to let go, heal, and reflect.

## Why Time Apart Is Non-Negotiable

Moving on means accepting uncertainty. It’s scary because you don’t know what’s next. But that’s what makes it worth it.

Stop clinging to each other out of fear. Don’t promise to stay friends. Don’t talk. Let go completely.

Only then can you truly process what happened and grow from it.

Maybe, in time, you’ll realize letting go was a mistake. Or maybe you’ll meet someone else who treats you better. Or, and this is often the best case, you’ll find peace in being single and focusing on yourself.

## You Deserve Better

Don’t deprive yourself of possibilities. Staying in a broken relationship out of fear or guilt only limits you.

Move on. Heal. And remember, you’re worthy of the kind of love that doesn’t make you question your value.
